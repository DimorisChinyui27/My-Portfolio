        <h2>üìú Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I am a self-taught software developer with 4 years of professional experience facilitating engineering solutions with a
          wide range of technical skills. Using my fullstack knowledge to create interactive applications
        </p>

        <p>
          I began my career in Software Development after high school with an internship at IRAD Cameroon, a public administrative
          institution focused on scientific research and agricultural development. Building various software products and rendering IT services at 
          the institute.
        </p>

        <p>
          After completing my internship, I received a scholarship covering 80% of my tuition to study Computer Science at Webster
          University in Geneva, Switzerland. However, due to a family tragedy and the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, I
          was forced to drop out as I could not afford the 20% tuition not covered by my scholarship and amounting to 7200CHF a
          year. Despite this setback, I decided to take on freelance work to support myself and continue building my skills.
